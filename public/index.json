Previous research suggests that certain predispositions, inductions, and interventions might mitigate the harmful effects of negative feedback. Among others, growth mindset beliefs and mindfulness meditation were proposed as the most promising candidates that may help students to retain motivation. In a pre-registered, randomized experiment, we gave a disappointing evaluation to 383 university students in a bogus laboratory IQ test situation. Half of the participants previously received a growth mindset induction referring to intelligence as a malleable characteristic, while the other half received a fixed mindset induction referring to intelligence as a stable characteristic that cannot be changed. Then participants had a brief mindfulness meditation session or a control condition. Subsequently, they could choose to complete practice tasks before the final IQ assessment. The number of completed optional tasks was used as a behavioral proxy for task persistence. The results showed no difference in task persistence for the growth mindset or the mindfulness induction groups, compared to the other conditions. However, those who reported having higher pre-induction growth mindset beliefs or dispositional mindfulness completed more optional tasks after the mindset or mindfulness induction, respectively. We concluded that our brief inductions may not be adequate for everyone to rectify the demotivating effects of negative feedback, but can enhance task persistence for people with a stronger disposition towards a growth mindset or mindfulness.","tags":[],"title":"Brief growth mindset and mindfulness inductions to facilitate task persistence after negative feedback","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1678320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678320000,"objectID":"c4c13c00ff9f616b5efafecdb50a7049","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/project/2023-03-09-multi100/","publishdate":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2023-03-09-multi100/","section":"project","summary":"As part of the Multi100 project, I reanalyzed the data from Huijts et al.

However, evidence for this hypothesis has been mixed. We thus formed a global adversarial collaboration and carried out a preregistered, multicentre study designed to specify and test the conditions that should most reliably produce facial feedback effects. Data from n = 3,878 participants spanning 19 countries indicated that a facial mimicry and voluntary facial action task could both amplify and initiate feelings of happiness. However, evidence of facial feedback effects was less conclusive when facial feedback was manipulated unobtrusively via a pen-in-mouth task.","tags":["corelab; emotion; facial feedback hypothesis; foundational test; replication"],"title":"A multi-lab test of the facial feedback hypothesis by the Many Smiles Collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Janos Salamon","Brian D Blume","István Tóth-Király","Tamás Nagy","Gábor Orosz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692788743,"objectID":"3f1f648bbb1b4959a5655c6d3df2feee","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/publication/salamon-2022-gm/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T11:05:43.056801Z","relpermalink":"/publication/salamon-2022-gm/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract According to previous studies, general environmental characteristics and job-related factors influence employees' transfer of learned skills to the job. However, among job-related variables, the role of work engagement in connection with transfer motivation, opportunity and training transfer has not received much research attention. Building upon the theoretical background of the Job Demands-Resources Model, the present study investigated the relationship between job resources/demands and training transfer through work engagement, transfer motivation and opportunity to transfer. Based on data from 311 working adults who participated in soft skill training programmes, job resources were associated with higher levels of training transfer through increased work engagement, motivation and opportunity to transfer. In contrast, job demands had negative relationships with transfer via work engagement and opportunity to transfer. The findings supported the assumption of the positive gain spiral in the transfer context. We conclude that companies should prioritize the development of job resources to provide a better environment for training transfer.","tags":[],"title":"The positive gain spiral of job resources, work engagement, opportunity and motivation on training transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657756800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657756800,"objectID":"b1304bc570759e5f84aa36ba510ea928","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/workshop/2022-07-14-regression_summer/","publishdate":"2022-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/2022-07-14-regression_summer/","section":"workshop","summary":"Regression summer course jointly held of the students of ELTE and University of Vienna.","tags":["r","methods"],"title":"Regression Summer School 22","type":"workshop"},{"authors":["Suzanne Hoogeveen","Alexandra Sarafoglou","Balazs Aczel","Yonathan Aditya","Alexandra J Alayan","Peter J Allen","Sacha Altay","Shilaan Alzahawi","Yulmaida Amir","Francis-Vincent Anthony","Obed Kwame Appiah","Quentin D Atkinson","Adam Baimel","Merve Balkaya-Ince","Michela Balsamo","Sachin Banker","František Bartoš","Mario Becerra","Bertrand Beffara","Julia Beitner","Theiss Bendixen","Jana B Berkessel","Renatas Berniūnas","Matthew I Billet","Joseph Billingsley","Tiago Bortolini","Heiko Breitsohl","Amélie Bret","Faith L Brown","Jennifer Brown","Claudia C Brumbaugh","Jacek Buczny","Joseph Bulbulia","Saúl Caballero","Leonardo Carlucci","Cheryl L Carmichael","Marco E G V Cattaneo","Sarah J Charles","Scott Claessens","Maxinne C Panagopoulos","Angelo Brandelli Costa","Damien L Crone","Stefan Czoschke","Christian Czymara","E Damiano D'Urso","Örjan Dahlström","Anna Dalla Rosa","Henrik Danielsson","Jill De Ron","Ymkje Anna de Vries","Kristy K Dean","Bryan J Dik","David J Disabato","Jaclyn K Doherty","Tim Draws","Lucas Drouhot","Marin Dujmovic","Yarrow Dunham","Tobias Ebert","Peter A Edelsbrunner","Anita Eerland","Christian T Elbaek","Shole Farahmand","Hooman Farahmand","Miguel Farias","Abrey A Feliccia","Kyle Fischer","Ronald Fischer","Donna Fisher-Thompson","Zoë Francis","Susanne Frick","Lisa K Frisch","Diogo Geraldes","Emily Gerdin","Linda Geven","Omid Ghasemi","Erwin Gielens","Vukašin Gligorić","Kristin Hagel","Nandor Hajdu","Hannah R Hamilton","Imaduddin Hamzah","Paul H P Hanel","Christopher E Hawk","Karel K.

Here, we adopted a many-analysts approach to assess the robustness of this relation based on a new cross-cultural dataset (N=10,535 participants from 24 countries). We recruited 120 analysis teams to investigate (1) whether religious people self-report higher well-being, and (2) whether the relation between religiosity and self-reported well-being depends on perceived cultural norms of religion (i.e., whether it is considered normal and desirable to be religious in a given country). In a two-stage procedure, the teams first created an analysis plan and then executed their planned analysis on the data. For the first research question, all but 3 teams reported positive effect sizes with credible/confidence intervals excluding zero (median reported ?=0.120). For the second research question, this was the case for 65% of the teams (median reported ?=0.039). While most teams applied (multilevel) linear regression models, there was considerable variability in the choice of items used to construct the independent variables, the dependent variable, and the included covariates.","tags":[],"title":"A many-analysts approach to the relation between religiosity and well-being","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bence Bago","Marton Kovacs","John

study of moral judgements often centres on moral dilemmas in which options consistent with deontological perspectives (that is, emphasizing rules, individual rights and duties) are in conflict with options consistent with utilitarian judgements (that is, following the greater good based on consequences). Greene et al. (2009) showed that psychological and situational factors (for example, the intent of the agent or the presence of physical contact between the agent and the victim) can play an important role in moral dilemma judgements (for example, the trolley problem). Our knowledge is limited concerning both the universality of these effects outside the United States and the impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the universality of the effects of intent and personal force on moral dilemma judgements by replicating the experiments of Greene et al. in 45 countries from all inhabited continents. We found that personal force and its interaction with intention exert influence on moral judgements in the US and Western cultural clusters, replicating and expanding the original findings. Moreover, the personal force effect was present in all cultural clusters, suggesting it is culturally universal. The evidence for the cultural universality of the interaction effect was inconclusive in the Eastern and Southern cultural clusters (depending on exclusion criteria). We found no strong association between collectivism/individualism and moral dilemma judgements.","tags":[],"title":"Situational factors shape moral judgements in the trolley dilemma in Eastern, Southern and Western countries in a culturally diverse sample","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1649116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649116800,"objectID":"1f250599a25586ee26221982a513cbe8","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/workshop/2022-04-05-vienna_power/","publishdate":"2022-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/2022-04-05-vienna_power/","section":"workshop","summary":"Workshop about simulation based power analysis in the University of Vienna.","tags":["R","methods"],"title":"Vienna power analyis in R workshop","type":"workshop"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1647216000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647216000,"objectID":"8e5733c64f6082d8aab624e8b177895a","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/workshop/2022-03-14-intro_to_r/","publishdate":"2022-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/2022-03-14-intro_to_r/","section":"workshop","summary":"Regression summer course jointly held of the students of ELTE and University of Vienna.","tags":["r"],"title":"Introduction to R and the tidyverse","type":"workshop"},{"authors":["Aniko Maraz","Tamás Nagy","Matthias Ziegler"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692788743,"objectID":"2e94156ac6f6155f8ce24784922f9b45","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/publication/maraz-2022-ge/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T11:05:43.531753Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maraz-2022-ge/","section":"publication","summary":"The present study assessed selected factors that contribute to the recollection of emotional memories over time.

We propose moving away from a dichotomous distinction to a more dynamic participation approach to better elucidate theoretical differences relating to self-determination theory. A sample of 311 trainees from eight companies participated in a variety of open skill (e.g., leadership) training programs. Results indicated that higher levels of voluntary participation were positively related to trainees' transfer motivation and training transfer. We also found that the level of voluntary participation moderates the relationship between supervisor support and both motivation to transfer and training transfer. Supervisor support facilitates trainee motivation and transfer to a larger extent when participation is less voluntary. Future training should be framed and promoted to increase employee motivation to voluntarily participate, especially for employees with less supervisor support.","tags":[],"title":"The interplay between the level of voluntary participation and supervisor support on trainee motivation and transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Janos Salamon","István Tóth-Király","Beáta Bõthe","Tamás Nagy","Gábor Orosz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692788745,"objectID":"22eb8e58dbe3b685688f3935c3afdbf4","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/publication/salamon-2021-xd/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T11:05:45.193633Z","relpermalink":"/publication/salamon-2021-xd/","section":"publication","summary":"Even though work engagement is a popular construct in organizational psychology, the question remains whether it is experienced as a global construct, or as its three components (vigor, dedication, absorption).

Based on responses provided by two distinct samples of employees (N 1 = 242, N 2 = 505), our results supported the superiority of the bifactor-CFA representation including a global factor of work engagement and three co-existing specific factors of vigor, dedication, and absorption. This representation replicated well across the two samples through tests of measurement invariance. Finally, while global work engagement was substantially related to all correlates, the specific factors also demonstrated meaningful associations over and above the global levels of work engagement.","tags":["basic psychological needs; bifactor-CFA; validity evidence based on test-criterion relationship; work addiction; work engagement; work satisfaction"],"title":"Having the Cake and Eating It Too: First-Order, Second-Order and Bifactor Representations of Work Engagement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Péter Simor","Bertalan Polner","Noémi Báthori","Rebeca Sifuentes-Ortega","Anke Van Roy","Ariadna Albajara Sáenz","Alba Luque González","Oumaima Benkirane","Tamás Nagy","Philippe Peigneux"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692788746,"objectID":"8ea8cc585880baa4fcb17f7ad3447cae","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/publication/simor-2021-fv/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T11:05:45.893228Z","relpermalink":"/publication/simor-2021-fv/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, populations from many countries have been confined at home for extended periods of time in stressful environmental and media conditions. Cross-sectional studies already evidence deleterious psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences for two consecutive weeks. The focus was set on between- and within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences, such as rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus. The results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints during the same day and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association was not paralleled by daytime mental complaints predicting relatively poorer sleep quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced by home confinement.","tags":["coronavirus; psychotic-like; rumination; sleep; somatic symptoms; tress"],"title":"Home confinement during the COVID-19: day-to-day associations of sleep quality with rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic symptoms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1621987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621987200,"objectID":"a2f7cac56a3347b7fb4ef2d84423b070","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/project/2021-05-26-bechdel/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2021-05-26-bechdel/","section":"project","summary":"I used the Bechdel test dataset from the TidyTuesday project to predict if a movie passed the test or not, based on the predicted gender of the writers.","tags":["R","statistics","regression","eda"],"title":"Passing the Bechdel test in movies","type":"project"},{"authors":["Aniko Maraz","Tamás Nagy","Matthias Ziegler"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692788745,"objectID":"f6ca40f2c0ad92d0baf5854f3b06233b","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/publication/maraz-2021-bv/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T11:05:45.42712Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maraz-2021-bv/","section":"publication","summary":"Summary The emotional valence of memory recall strongly influences the extreme, and often self-destructive behavioral response.

To provide more reliable results, we included robust frequentist as well as Bayesian statistical analyses. Unequivocally across all analyses, we showed that there is no association between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance in the domains of working memory, executive functions and procedural learning in healthy young adults.

Amongst other functions, SWS plays a crucial role in the restorative capacity of sleep. Rhythmic acoustic stimulation (RAS) during SWS has been shown a cost-effective method to enhance slow wave activity. Slow wave activity can be expressed in a region-specific manner as a function of previous waking activity. However, it is unclear whether slow waves can be enhanced in a region-specific manner using RAS. We investigated the effects of unilaterally presented rhythmic acoustic sound patterns on sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations. Thirty-five participants received during SWS 12-second long rhythmic bursts of pink noise (at a rate of 1 Hz) that alternated with non-stimulated, silent periods, unilaterally delivered into one of the ears of the participants. As expected, RAS enhanced delta power, especially in its low-frequency components between 0.75 and 2.25 Hz. However, increased slow oscillatory activity was apparent in both hemispheres regardless of the side of the stimulation. The most robust increases in slow oscillatory activity appeared during the first 3-4 seconds of the stimulation period. Furthermore, a short-lasting increase in theta and sigma power was evidenced immediately after the first pulse of the stimulation sequences. Our findings indicate that lateralized RAS has a strong potential to globally enhance slow waves during daytime naps. The lack of localized effects suggests that slow waves are triggered by the ascending reticular system and not directly by specific auditory pathways.","tags":[],"title":"Lateralized rhythmic acoustic stimulation during daytime NREM sleep enhances slow waves","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527292800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527292800,"objectID":"22dd8ab6dc644d38c277b1556cd511bd","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/project/2018-05-26-got_marriage_survival/","publishdate":"2018-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-05-26-got_marriage_survival/","section":"project","summary":"I created a custom animated map to show each Game of Thorones birth and death event, and performed a Cox-regression for married and unmarried characters.","tags":["R","statistics","animated","map","survival analysis","regression"],"title":"Analysis on Game of Thrones marriage survival","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1505865600,"objectID":"b99c1c1f4214e54f370533e2e557a5a2","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/project/2017-09-20-trump_un_speech_analysis/","publishdate":"2017-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2017-09-20-trump_un_speech_analysis/","section":"project","summary":"I used text mining and sentiment analysis on Trump's first UN speech.","tags":["R","statistics","text","nlp","sentiment","politics","eda"],"title":"Text mining Donald Trump's first UN speech","type":"project"},{"authors":["T Nagy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692788744,"objectID":"9a2ccf895d7f352b34d55d9e01efcfa3","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/publication/nagy-2016-dc/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T11:05:44.475599Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nagy-2016-dc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Psychophysiological responses to distress and eustress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tamás Nagy","Gyöngyvér Salavecz","Péter Simor","György Purebl","Róbert Bódizs","Samantha Dockray","Andrew Steptoe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692788743,"objectID":"1e889e070271fc82fbbe361bdd23da69","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/publication/nagy-2015-nw/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T11:05:43.767815Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nagy-2015-nw/","section":"publication","summary":"Nightmares are relatively common sleep complaints that seem to be associated with affective distress.

Unstimulated saliva was collected repeatedly during and after each laboratory stressor, and sAA concentration (U/ml) and secretion (U/minute) determined. Both stressors increased anxiety. The MT caused an immediate and continued cardiac SNS activation, but sAA concentration increased at task cessation only (+54%); i.e., when there was SNS-PNS co-activation. During the MT sAA secretion even decreased (-35%) in conjunction with flow rate and vagal tone. The CPT robustly increased blood pressure but not sAA.

In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that (1) suggestive interventions are useful for reducing postoperative side effects; (2) therapeutic suggestions are comparable in effectiveness to hypnosis; (3) live presentation is more effective than recordings; and (4) suggestive interventions would be equally effective used in minor and major surgeries. METHODS: We performed random effect meta-analysis with meta-regression and sensitivity analysis by moderating factors on a pool of 26 studies meeting the inclusion criteria (N = 1890). Outcome variables were postoperative anxiety, pain intensity, pain medication requirement, and nausea. RESULTS: Suggestive interventions reduced postoperative anxiety (g = 0.40; 99% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.66; P \u003c 0.001) and pain intensity (g = 0.25; 99% CI = 0.00-0.50; P = 0.010), but did not significantly affect postoperative analgesic drug consumption (g = 0.16; 99% CI = -0.16 to 0.47; P = 0.202) and nausea (g = 0.38; 99% CI = -0.06 to 0.81; P = 0.026). No significant differences were found for intervention type, presentation method, and severity of surgery; however, sensitivity analysis only supported the effectiveness of hypnosis (g = 0.62; 99% CI = 0.31-0.92; P \u003c 0.001) and live presentation (g = 0.55; 99% CI = 0.23-0.88; P \u003c 0.001) for decreasing postoperative anxiety, and that of live presentation for alleviating postoperative pain (g = 0.44; 99% CI = 0.07-0.82; P = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses also suggested that suggestive interventions are only effective for decreasing pain intensity during minor surgical procedures (g = 0.39; 99% CI = 0.00-0.78; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Suggestive techniques might be useful tools to alleviate postoperative anxiety and pain; however, strength of the evidence is weak because of possible bias in the reviewed articles. The lack of access to within-subjects data and the overlap between moderator conditions also limit the scope of the analysis. More methodologically correct studies are required with sensitivity to moderating factors and to within-subjects changes. For clinical purposes, we advise the use of hypnosis with live presentation to reduce postoperative anxiety and pain, until convincing evidence is uncovered for the effectiveness of therapeutic suggestions and recorded presentation. Pain management with adjunct suggestive interventions is mostly encouraged in minor rather than major surgeries.","tags":[],"title":"The effectiveness of suggestive techniques in reducing postoperative side effects: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katalin Bálint","Tamás Nagy","Márta Csabai"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1412121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692788745,"objectID":"b920e78a31b58deaadb453d6ea5e6c7f","permalink":"https://nagytamas.netlify.app/publication/balint-2014-kp/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T11:05:44.955913Z","relpermalink":"/publication/balint-2014-kp/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: To examine how certain characteristics of film-presented practitioner role-models influence trainees' mentalization. METHODS: In an experimental setting, psychology students watched four film clips presenting a patient-practitioner session; the clips varied in the practitioner's patient-centeredness (positive vs. negative) and gender. Participants commented on the practitioner's thoughts, emotions and intentions through the session. Analysis of 116 comments focused on the effect of patient-centeredness and gender variables on mentalization and judgment utterances. RESULTS: Negative role-models and female role-models induced higher levels of mentalization compared to positive and male role-models. There was no gender difference in the level of mentalization; however male participants gave more judgmental responses than female participants. The patient-centeredness had a larger effect on mentalization when trainees described the opposite gender role-model. CONCLUSION: In a systematic comparison, students' capacity for mentalization differed according to role-models' patient-centeredness and gender, as well as the gender-match of students with role-models. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: When working with film-presented role-models, educators should be aware of the differences in the level of mentalization elicited by positive and male role-models, as opposed to negative and female role-models. Educators should also consider the gender-match between trainees and role-models, therefore students should be exposed to both cross- and same-gender role-models.","tags":["Film-aided education; Gender differences; Medical education; Mentalization; Patient-centeredness; Role modeling"],"title":"The effect of patient-centeredness and gender of professional role models on trainees' mentalization responses.
