  abstract  = "Negative feedback in academic settings is often unavoidable,
               although it may directly interfere with the ultimate goal of
               education, as setbacks can diminish motivation, and may even
               lead to dropping out of school. Previous research suggests that
               certain predispositions, inductions, and interventions might
               mitigate the harmful effects of negative feedback. Among others,
               growth mindset beliefs and mindfulness meditation were proposed
               as the most promising candidates that may help students to
               retain motivation. In a pre-registered, randomized experiment,
               we gave a disappointing evaluation to 383 university students in
               a bogus laboratory IQ test situation. Half of the participants
               previously received a growth mindset induction referring to
               intelligence as a malleable characteristic, while the other half
               received a fixed mindset induction referring to intelligence as
               a stable characteristic that cannot be changed. Then
               participants had a brief mindfulness meditation session or a
               control condition. Subsequently, they could choose to complete
               practice tasks before the final IQ assessment. The number of
               completed optional tasks was used as a behavioral proxy for task
               persistence. The results showed no difference in task
               persistence for the growth mindset or the mindfulness induction
               groups, compared to the other conditions. However, those who
               reported having higher pre-induction growth mindset beliefs or
               dispositional mindfulness completed more optional tasks after
               the mindset or mindfulness induction, respectively. We concluded
               that our brief inductions may not be adequate for everyone to
               rectify the demotivating effects of negative feedback, but can
               enhance task persistence for people with a stronger disposition
               towards a growth mindset or mindfulness.",

  abstract = "Slow wave sleep (SWS) is characterized by the predominance of
              delta waves and slow oscillations, reflecting the synchronized
              activity of large cortical neuronal populations. Amongst other
              functions, SWS plays a crucial role in the restorative capacity
              of sleep. Rhythmic acoustic stimulation (RAS) during SWS has been
              shown a cost-effective method to enhance slow wave activity. Slow
              wave activity can be expressed in a region-specific manner as a
              function of previous waking activity. However, it is unclear
              whether slow waves can be enhanced in a region-specific manner
              using RAS. We investigated the effects of unilaterally presented
              rhythmic acoustic sound patterns on sleep electroencephalographic
              (EEG) oscillations. Thirty-five participants received during SWS
              12-second long rhythmic bursts of pink noise (at a rate of 1 Hz)
              that alternated with non-stimulated, silent periods, unilaterally
              delivered into one of the ears of the participants. As expected,
              RAS enhanced delta power, especially in its low-frequency
              components between 0.75 and 2.25 Hz. However, increased slow
              oscillatory activity was apparent in both hemispheres regardless
              of the side of the stimulation. The most robust increases in slow
              oscillatory activity appeared during the first 3-4 seconds of the
              stimulation period. Furthermore, a short-lasting increase in
              theta and sigma power was evidenced immediately after the first
              pulse of the stimulation sequences. Our findings indicate that
              lateralized RAS has a strong potential to globally enhance slow
              waves during daytime naps. The lack of localized effects suggests
              that slow waves are triggered by the ascending reticular system
              and not directly by specific auditory pathways.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTThe relation between religiosity and well-being is one
               of the most researched topics in the psychology of religion, yet
               the directionality and robustness of the effect remains debated.
               Here, we adopted a many-analysts approach to assess the
               robustness of this relation based on a new cross-cultural
               dataset (N=10,535 participants from 24 countries). We recruited
               120 analysis teams to investigate (1) whether religious people
               self-report higher well-being, and (2) whether the relation
               between religiosity and self-reported well-being depends on
               perceived cultural norms of religion (i.e., whether it is
               considered normal and desirable to be religious in a given
               country). In a two-stage procedure, the teams first created an
               analysis plan and then executed their planned analysis on the
               data. For the first research question, all but 3 teams reported
               positive effect sizes with credible/confidence intervals
               excluding zero (median reported ?=0.120). For the second
               research question, this was the case for 65\% of the teams
               (median reported ?=0.039). While most teams applied (multilevel)
               linear regression models, there was considerable variability in
               the choice of items used to construct the independent variables,
               the dependent variable, and the included covariates.",

  abstract  = "Abstract According to previous studies, general environmental
               characteristics and job-related factors influence employees'
               transfer of learned skills to the job. However, among
               job-related variables, the role of work engagement in connection
               with transfer motivation, opportunity and training transfer has
               not received much research attention. Building upon the
               theoretical background of the Job Demands-Resources Model, the
               present study investigated the relationship between job
               resources/demands and training transfer through work engagement,
               transfer motivation and opportunity to transfer. Based on data
               from 311 working adults who participated in soft skill training
               programmes, job resources were associated with higher levels of
               training transfer through increased work engagement, motivation
               and opportunity to transfer. In contrast, job demands had
               negative relationships with transfer via work engagement and
               opportunity to transfer. The findings supported the assumption
               of the positive gain spiral in the transfer context. We conclude
               that companies should prioritize the development of job
               resources to provide a better environment for training transfer.",

  abstract = "The study of moral judgements often centres on moral dilemmas in
              which options consistent with deontological perspectives (that
              is, emphasizing rules, individual rights and duties) are in
              conflict with options consistent with utilitarian judgements
              (that is, following the greater good based on consequences).
              Greene et al. (2009) showed that psychological and situational
              factors (for example, the intent of the agent or the presence of
              physical contact between the agent and the victim) can play an
              important role in moral dilemma judgements (for example, the
              trolley problem). Our knowledge is limited concerning both the
              universality of these effects outside the United States and the
              impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors
              affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the
              universality of the effects of intent and personal force on moral
              dilemma judgements by replicating the experiments of Greene et
              al. in 45 countries from all inhabited continents. We found that
              personal force and its interaction with intention exert influence
              on moral judgements in the US and Western cultural clusters,
              replicating and expanding the original findings. Moreover, the
              personal force effect was present in all cultural clusters,
              suggesting it is culturally universal. The evidence for the
              cultural universality of the interaction effect was inconclusive
              in the Eastern and Southern cultural clusters (depending on
              exclusion criteria). We found no strong association between
              collectivism/individualism and moral dilemma judgements.",

               BPD, regardless of stimulus valence. The level of BPD had an
               effect only when negative evaluative wording (e.g., ``guilty'')

              the MT sAA secretion even decreased (-35\%) in conjunction with
              flow rate and vagal tone. The CPT robustly increased blood
              pressure but not sAA. In summary, sAA fluctuations did not

               paper aims to examine whether the number of coworkers

               influence training motivation and
               transfer.Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a
               cross-sectional survey from a sample of 688 employees working in
               14 midsize and large companies. All participants were recent
               trainees in various open skill (e.g. leadership) training
               programs. Moderated mediation was used to test the
               hypotheses.Findings Motivation to transfer (MTT) mediated the
               relationship between PS and perceived training transfer. When
               more coworkers participated in the training, PS had a stronger
               influence on trainee MTT.Practical implications Organizations
               should consider training coworker cohorts at the same time to
               influence MTT and training transfer. Generally, whole-team
               training programs could be used to boost training transfer
               outcomes, although it could potentially have a negative impact
               on transfer if PS is low.Originality/value To the best of the
               authors' knowledge, this was the first study to demonstrate that
               the number of coworkers participating in training can moderate
               the effect of PS on MTT and training transfer.",

              students watched four film clips presenting a
              patient-practitioner session; the clips varied in the
              practitioner's patient-centeredness (positive vs. negative) and
              gender. Participants commented on the practitioner's thoughts,
              emotions and intentions through the session. Analysis of 116
              comments focused on the effect of patient-centeredness and gender
              variables on mentalization and judgment utterances. RESULTS:
              Negative role-models and female role-models induced higher levels
              of mentalization compared to positive and male role-models. There
              was no gender difference in the level of mentalization; however
              male participants gave more judgmental responses than female
              participants. The patient-centeredness had a larger effect on
              mentalization when trainees described the opposite gender
              role-model. CONCLUSION: In a systematic comparison, students'
              capacity for mentalization differed according to role-models'
              patient-centeredness and gender, as well as the gender-match of
              students with role-models. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: When working
              with film-presented role-models, educators should be aware of the
              differences in the level of mentalization elicited by positive
              and male role-models, as opposed to negative and female
              role-models. Educators should also consider the gender-match
              between trainees and role-models, therefore students should be
              exposed to both cross- and same-gender role-models.",

              therapeutic suggestions are frequently used to alleviate surgical
              side effects; however, the effectiveness of therapeutic
              suggestion intervention has not yet been systematically
              evaluated. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that
              (1) suggestive interventions are useful for reducing
              postoperative side effects; (2) therapeutic suggestions are
              comparable in effectiveness to hypnosis; (3) live presentation is
              more effective than recordings; and (4) suggestive interventions
              would be equally effective used in minor and major surgeries.
              METHODS: We performed random effect meta-analysis with
              meta-regression and sensitivity analysis by moderating factors on
              a pool of 26 studies meeting the inclusion criteria (N = 1890).
              Outcome variables were postoperative anxiety, pain intensity,
              pain medication requirement, and nausea. RESULTS: Suggestive
              interventions reduced postoperative anxiety (g = 0.40; 99\%
              confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.66; P < 0.001) and pain
              intensity (g = 0.25; 99\% CI = 0.00-0.50; P = 0.010), but did not
              significantly affect postoperative analgesic drug consumption (g
              = 0.16; 99\% CI = -0.16 to 0.47; P = 0.202) and nausea (g = 0.38;
              99\% CI = -0.06 to 0.81; P = 0.026). No significant differences
              were found for intervention type, presentation method, and
              severity of surgery; however, sensitivity analysis only supported
              the effectiveness of hypnosis (g = 0.62; 99\% CI = 0.31-0.92; P <
              0.001) and live presentation (g = 0.55; 99\% CI = 0.23-0.88; P <
              0.001) for decreasing postoperative anxiety, and that of live
              presentation for alleviating postoperative pain (g = 0.44; 99\%
              CI = 0.07-0.82; P = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses also suggested
              that suggestive interventions are only effective for decreasing
              pain intensity during minor surgical procedures (g = 0.39; 99\%
              CI = 0.00-0.78; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Suggestive techniques
              might be useful tools to alleviate postoperative anxiety and
              pain; however, strength of the evidence is weak because of
              possible bias in the reviewed articles. The lack of access to
              within-subjects data and the overlap between moderator conditions
              also limit the scope of the analysis. More methodologically
              correct studies are required with sensitivity to moderating
              factors and to within-subjects changes. For clinical purposes, we
              advise the use of hypnosis with live presentation to reduce
              postoperative anxiety and pain, until convincing evidence is
              uncovered for the effectiveness of therapeutic suggestions and
              recorded presentation. Pain management with adjunct suggestive
              interventions is mostly encouraged in minor rather than major
              surgeries.",
