abstract: Abstract According to previous studies, general environmental characteristics
  and job-related factors influence employees' transfer of learned skills to the job.
  However, among job-related variables, the role of work engagement in connection
  with transfer motivation, opportunity and training transfer has not received much
  research attention. Building upon the theoretical background of the Job Demands-Resources
  Model, the present study investigated the relationship between job resources/demands
  and training transfer through work engagement, transfer motivation and opportunity
  to transfer. Based on data from 311 working adults who participated in soft skill
  training programmes, job resources were associated with higher levels of training
  transfer through increased work engagement, motivation and opportunity to transfer.
  In contrast, job demands had negative relationships with transfer via work engagement
  and opportunity to transfer. The findings supported the assumption of the positive
  gain spiral in the transfer context. We conclude that companies should prioritize
  the development of job resources to provide a better environment for training transfer.
