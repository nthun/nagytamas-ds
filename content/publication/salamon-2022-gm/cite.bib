 abstract = {Abstract According to previous studies, general environmental
characteristics and job-related factors influence employees'
transfer of learned skills to the job. However, among
job-related variables, the role of work engagement in connection
with transfer motivation, opportunity and training transfer has
not received much research attention. Building upon the
theoretical background of the Job Demands-Resources Model, the
present study investigated the relationship between job
resources/demands and training transfer through work engagement,
transfer motivation and opportunity to transfer. Based on data
from 311 working adults who participated in soft skill training
programmes, job resources were associated with higher levels of
training transfer through increased work engagement, motivation
and opportunity to transfer. In contrast, job demands had
negative relationships with transfer via work engagement and
opportunity to transfer. The findings supported the assumption
of the positive gain spiral in the transfer context. We conclude
that companies should prioritize the development of job
resources to provide a better environment for training transfer.},
