 abstract = {This large, international dataset contains survey responses from
N = 12,570 students from 100 universities in 35 countries,
collected in 21 languages. We measured anxieties (statistics,
mathematics, test, trait, social interaction, performance,
creativity, intolerance of uncertainty, and fear of negative
evaluation), self-efficacy, persistence, and the cognitive
reflection test, and collected demographics, previous
mathematics grades, self-reported and official statistics
grades, and statistics module details. Data reuse potential is
broad, including testing links between anxieties and
statistics/mathematics education factors, and examining
instruments' psychometric properties across different languages
and contexts. Data and metadata are stored on the Open Science
Framework website [https://osf.io/mhg94/].},
