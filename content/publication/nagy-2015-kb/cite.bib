 abstract = {Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) is used as a sympathetic (SNS)
stress marker, though its release is likely co-determined by SNS
and parasympathetic (PNS) activation. The SNS and PNS show
asynchronous changes during acute stressors, and sAA responses
may thus vary with sample timing. Thirty-four participants
underwent an eight-minute memory task (MT) and cold pressor task
(CPT). Cardiovascular SNS (pre-ejection period, blood pressure)
and PNS (heart rate variability) activity were monitored
continuously. Unstimulated saliva was collected repeatedly during
and after each laboratory stressor, and sAA concentration (U/ml)
and secretion (U/minute) determined. Both stressors increased
anxiety. The MT caused an immediate and continued cardiac SNS
activation, but sAA concentration increased at task cessation
only (+54%); i.e., when there was SNS-PNS co-activation. During
the MT sAA secretion even decreased (-35%) in conjunction with
flow rate and vagal tone. The CPT robustly increased blood
pressure but not sAA. In summary, sAA fluctuations did not
parallel changes in cardiac SNS activity or anxiety. sAA
responses seem contingent on sample timing and flow rate, likely
involving both SNS and PNS influences. Verification using other
stressors and contexts seems warranted.},
