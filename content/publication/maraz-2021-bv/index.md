abstract: 'Summary The emotional valence of memory recall strongly influences the
  extreme, and often self-destructive behavioral response. Overall, 4427 people from
  the community filled out our screening questionnaire, of which 674 (mean age: 32.9?years,
  64.7% women) passed the threshold for the likely presence of borderline personality
  disorder (BPD). Participants watched one of 9 possible video clips differing in
  valence (positive, negative or neutral). Results indicate support (ß = .151, p?<?.05)
  for a negative cognitive tendency in the evaluations proportionate to the severity
  of BPD but only when the impression is assessed with negatively-worded items. This
  effect is detectable regardless of other factors such as negative mood, extremity
  of the answers or general impression of the character. These effects are unaffected
  by acute trauma. To conclude, different factors influence the recall of emotional
  stimuli, depending on the valence of the stimuli and the valence of the rating scale
  in persons with strong borderline tendencies.'
