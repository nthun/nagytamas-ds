 abstract = {Summary The emotional valence of memory recall strongly
influences the extreme, and often self-destructive behavioral
response. Overall, 4427 people from the community filled out our
screening questionnaire, of which 674 (mean age: 32.9?years,
64.7% women) passed the threshold for the likely presence of
borderline personality disorder (BPD). Participants watched one
of 9 possible video clips differing in valence (positive,
negative or neutral). Results indicate support (ß = .151,
p?<?.05) for a negative cognitive tendency in the evaluations
proportionate to the severity of BPD but only when the
impression is assessed with negatively-worded items. This effect
is detectable regardless of other factors such as negative mood,
extremity of the answers or general impression of the character.
These effects are unaffected by acute trauma. To conclude,
different factors influence the recall of emotional stimuli,
depending on the valence of the stimuli and the valence of the
rating scale in persons with strong borderline tendencies.},
