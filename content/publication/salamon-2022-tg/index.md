abstract: Purpose The impact of the number of coworkers participating in training
  on transfer outcomes has largely been overlooked. This paper aims to examine whether
  the number of coworkers participating in training interacts with peer support (PS)
  to influence training motivation and transfer.Design/methodology/approach Data were
  collected using a cross-sectional survey from a sample of 688 employees working
  in 14 midsize and large companies. All participants were recent trainees in various
  open skill (e.g. leadership) training programs. Moderated mediation was used to
  test the hypotheses.Findings Motivation to transfer (MTT) mediated the relationship
  between PS and perceived training transfer. When more coworkers participated in
  the training, PS had a stronger influence on trainee MTT.Practical implications
  Organizations should consider training coworker cohorts at the same time to influence
  MTT and training transfer. Generally, whole-team training programs could be used
  to boost training transfer outcomes, although it could potentially have a negative
  impact on transfer if PS is low.Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge,
  this was the first study to demonstrate that the number of coworkers participating
  in training can moderate the effect of PS on MTT and training transfer.
