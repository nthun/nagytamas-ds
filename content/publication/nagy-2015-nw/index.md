abstract: Nightmares are relatively common sleep complaints that seem to be associated
  with affective distress. To date, few attempts have been made to link nightmares
  to the biological markers of the stress response, and the HPA response in particular.
  The present study examined the relationship between frequent nightmares and the
  cortisol awakening response (CAR) in a cross-sectional study of working women (N=188).
  Analysis revealed that those who reported frequent nightmares (N=13) showed a blunted
  CAR on a working day, compared to those who did not report nightmares. This result
  was independent of psychiatric symptoms, demographic variables, and lifestyle. Our
  preliminary findings suggest that decreased HPA reactivity might be a trait-like
  feature of women with frequent nightmares.
