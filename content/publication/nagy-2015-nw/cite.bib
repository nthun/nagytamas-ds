 abstract = {Nightmares are relatively common sleep complaints that seem to be
associated with affective distress. To date, few attempts have
been made to link nightmares to the biological markers of the
stress response, and the HPA response in particular. The present
study examined the relationship between frequent nightmares and
the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in a cross-sectional study
of working women (N=188). Analysis revealed that those who
reported frequent nightmares (N=13) showed a blunted CAR on a
working day, compared to those who did not report nightmares.
This result was independent of psychiatric symptoms, demographic
variables, and lifestyle. Our preliminary findings suggest that
decreased HPA reactivity might be a trait-like feature of women
with frequent nightmares.},
