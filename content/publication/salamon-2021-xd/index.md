abstract: Even though work engagement is a popular construct in organizational psychology,
  the question remains whether it is experienced as a global construct, or as its
  three components (vigor, dedication, absorption). The present study thus contributes
  to the ongoing scientific debate about the dimensionality of work engagement systematically
  compared one-factor, first-order, higher-order, and bifactor confirmatory factor
  analytic (CFA) representations of work engagement measured by the short version
  of Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9). We also documented the validity evidence
  of the most optimal representation based on its test-criterion relationship with
  basic psychological need fulfillment at work, turnover intentions, work addiction,
  and work satisfaction. Based on responses provided by two distinct samples of employees
  (N 1 = 242, N 2 = 505), our results supported the superiority of the bifactor-CFA
  representation including a global factor of work engagement and three co-existing
  specific factors of vigor, dedication, and absorption. This representation replicated
  well across the two samples through tests of measurement invariance. Finally, while
  global work engagement was substantially related to all correlates, the specific
  factors also demonstrated meaningful associations over and above the global levels
  of work engagement.
