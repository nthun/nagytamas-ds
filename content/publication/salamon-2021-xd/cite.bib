 abstract = {Even though work engagement is a popular construct in
organizational psychology, the question remains whether it is
experienced as a global construct, or as its three components
(vigor, dedication, absorption). The present study thus
contributes to the ongoing scientific debate about the
dimensionality of work engagement systematically compared
one-factor, first-order, higher-order, and bifactor confirmatory
factor analytic (CFA) representations of work engagement measured
by the short version of Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9).
We also documented the validity evidence of the most optimal
representation based on its test-criterion relationship with
basic psychological need fulfillment at work, turnover
intentions, work addiction, and work satisfaction. Based on
responses provided by two distinct samples of employees (N 1 =
242, N 2 = 505), our results supported the superiority of the
bifactor-CFA representation including a global factor of work
engagement and three co-existing specific factors of vigor,
dedication, and absorption. This representation replicated well
across the two samples through tests of measurement invariance.
Finally, while global work engagement was substantially related
to all correlates, the specific factors also demonstrated
meaningful associations over and above the global levels of work
engagement.},
