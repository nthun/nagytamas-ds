 abstract = {The study of moral judgements often centres on moral dilemmas in
which options consistent with deontological perspectives (that
is, emphasizing rules, individual rights and duties) are in
conflict with options consistent with utilitarian judgements
(that is, following the greater good based on consequences).
Greene et al. (2009) showed that psychological and situational
factors (for example, the intent of the agent or the presence of
physical contact between the agent and the victim) can play an
important role in moral dilemma judgements (for example, the
trolley problem). Our knowledge is limited concerning both the
universality of these effects outside the United States and the
impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors
affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the
universality of the effects of intent and personal force on moral
dilemma judgements by replicating the experiments of Greene et
al. in 45 countries from all inhabited continents. We found that
personal force and its interaction with intention exert influence
on moral judgements in the US and Western cultural clusters,
replicating and expanding the original findings. Moreover, the
personal force effect was present in all cultural clusters,
suggesting it is culturally universal. The evidence for the
cultural universality of the interaction effect was inconclusive
in the Eastern and Southern cultural clusters (depending on
exclusion criteria). We found no strong association between
collectivism/individualism and moral dilemma judgements.},
