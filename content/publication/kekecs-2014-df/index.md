abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Suggestive interventions such as hypnosis and therapeutic suggestions
  are frequently used to alleviate surgical side effects; however, the effectiveness
  of therapeutic suggestion intervention has not yet been systematically evaluated.
  In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that (1) suggestive interventions
  are useful for reducing postoperative side effects; (2) therapeutic suggestions
  are comparable in effectiveness to hypnosis; (3) live presentation is more effective
  than recordings; and (4) suggestive interventions would be equally effective used
  in minor and major surgeries. METHODS: We performed random effect meta-analysis
  with meta-regression and sensitivity analysis by moderating factors on a pool of
  26 studies meeting the inclusion criteria (N = 1890). Outcome variables were postoperative
  anxiety, pain intensity, pain medication requirement, and nausea. RESULTS: Suggestive
  interventions reduced postoperative anxiety (g = 0.40; 99% confidence interval [CI]
  = 0.13-0.66; P < 0.001) and pain intensity (g = 0.25; 99% CI = 0.00-0.50; P = 0.010),
  but did not significantly affect postoperative analgesic drug consumption (g = 0.16;
  99% CI = -0.16 to 0.47; P = 0.202) and nausea (g = 0.38; 99% CI = -0.06 to 0.81;
  P = 0.026). No significant differences were found for intervention type, presentation
  method, and severity of surgery; however, sensitivity analysis only supported the
  effectiveness of hypnosis (g = 0.62; 99% CI = 0.31-0.92; P < 0.001) and live presentation
  (g = 0.55; 99% CI = 0.23-0.88; P < 0.001) for decreasing postoperative anxiety,
  and that of live presentation for alleviating postoperative pain (g = 0.44; 99%
  CI = 0.07-0.82; P = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses also suggested that suggestive
  interventions are only effective for decreasing pain intensity during minor surgical
  procedures (g = 0.39; 99% CI = 0.00-0.78; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Suggestive techniques
  might be useful tools to alleviate postoperative anxiety and pain; however, strength
  of the evidence is weak because of possible bias in the reviewed articles. The lack
  of access to within-subjects data and the overlap between moderator conditions also
  limit the scope of the analysis. More methodologically correct studies are required
  with sensitivity to moderating factors and to within-subjects changes. For clinical
  purposes, we advise the use of hypnosis with live presentation to reduce postoperative
  anxiety and pain, until convincing evidence is uncovered for the effectiveness of
  therapeutic suggestions and recorded presentation. Pain management with adjunct
  suggestive interventions is mostly encouraged in minor rather than major surgeries.'
