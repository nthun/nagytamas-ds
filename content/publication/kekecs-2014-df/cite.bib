 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suggestive interventions such as hypnosis and
therapeutic suggestions are frequently used to alleviate surgical
side effects; however, the effectiveness of therapeutic
suggestion intervention has not yet been systematically
evaluated. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that
(1) suggestive interventions are useful for reducing
postoperative side effects; (2) therapeutic suggestions are
comparable in effectiveness to hypnosis; (3) live presentation is
more effective than recordings; and (4) suggestive interventions
would be equally effective used in minor and major surgeries.
METHODS: We performed random effect meta-analysis with
meta-regression and sensitivity analysis by moderating factors on
a pool of 26 studies meeting the inclusion criteria (N = 1890).
Outcome variables were postoperative anxiety, pain intensity,
pain medication requirement, and nausea. RESULTS: Suggestive
interventions reduced postoperative anxiety (g = 0.40; 99%
confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.66; P < 0.001) and pain
intensity (g = 0.25; 99% CI = 0.00-0.50; P = 0.010), but did not
significantly affect postoperative analgesic drug consumption (g
= 0.16; 99% CI = -0.16 to 0.47; P = 0.202) and nausea (g = 0.38;
99% CI = -0.06 to 0.81; P = 0.026). No significant differences
were found for intervention type, presentation method, and
severity of surgery; however, sensitivity analysis only supported
the effectiveness of hypnosis (g = 0.62; 99% CI = 0.31-0.92; P <
0.001) and live presentation (g = 0.55; 99% CI = 0.23-0.88; P <
0.001) for decreasing postoperative anxiety, and that of live
presentation for alleviating postoperative pain (g = 0.44; 99%
CI = 0.07-0.82; P = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses also suggested
that suggestive interventions are only effective for decreasing
pain intensity during minor surgical procedures (g = 0.39; 99%
CI = 0.00-0.78; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Suggestive techniques
might be useful tools to alleviate postoperative anxiety and
pain; however, strength of the evidence is weak because of
possible bias in the reviewed articles. The lack of access to
within-subjects data and the overlap between moderator conditions
also limit the scope of the analysis. More methodologically
correct studies are required with sensitivity to moderating
factors and to within-subjects changes. For clinical purposes, we
advise the use of hypnosis with live presentation to reduce
postoperative anxiety and pain, until convincing evidence is
uncovered for the effectiveness of therapeutic suggestions and
recorded presentation. Pain management with adjunct suggestive
interventions is mostly encouraged in minor rather than major
surgeries.},
