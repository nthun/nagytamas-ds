 abstract = {Abstract There have been conflicting findings about whether
mandatory versus voluntary training leads to more positive
training outcomes. We propose moving away from a dichotomous
distinction to a more dynamic participation approach to better
elucidate theoretical differences relating to self-determination
theory. A sample of 311 trainees from eight companies
participated in a variety of open skill (e.g., leadership)
training programs. Results indicated that higher levels of
voluntary participation were positively related to trainees'
transfer motivation and training transfer. We also found that
the level of voluntary participation moderates the relationship
between supervisor support and both motivation to transfer and
training transfer. Supervisor support facilitates trainee
motivation and transfer to a larger extent when participation is
less voluntary. Future training should be framed and promoted to
increase employee motivation to voluntarily participate,
especially for employees with less supervisor support.},
