abstract: Abstract There have been conflicting findings about whether mandatory versus
  voluntary training leads to more positive training outcomes. We propose moving away
  from a dichotomous distinction to a more dynamic participation approach to better
  elucidate theoretical differences relating to self-determination theory. A sample
  of 311 trainees from eight companies participated in a variety of open skill (e.g.,
  leadership) training programs. Results indicated that higher levels of voluntary
  participation were positively related to trainees' transfer motivation and training
  transfer. We also found that the level of voluntary participation moderates the
  relationship between supervisor support and both motivation to transfer and training
  transfer. Supervisor support facilitates trainee motivation and transfer to a larger
  extent when participation is less voluntary. Future training should be framed and
  promoted to increase employee motivation to voluntarily participate, especially
  for employees with less supervisor support.
