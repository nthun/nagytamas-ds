abstract: Slow wave sleep (SWS) is characterized by the predominance of delta waves
  and slow oscillations, reflecting the synchronized activity of large cortical neuronal
  populations. Amongst other functions, SWS plays a crucial role in the restorative
  capacity of sleep. Rhythmic acoustic stimulation (RAS) during SWS has been shown
  a cost-effective method to enhance slow wave activity. Slow wave activity can be
  expressed in a region-specific manner as a function of previous waking activity.
  However, it is unclear whether slow waves can be enhanced in a region-specific manner
  using RAS. We investigated the effects of unilaterally presented rhythmic acoustic
  sound patterns on sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations. Thirty-five
  participants received during SWS 12-second long rhythmic bursts of pink noise (at
  a rate of 1 Hz) that alternated with non-stimulated, silent periods, unilaterally
  delivered into one of the ears of the participants. As expected, RAS enhanced delta
  power, especially in its low-frequency components between 0.75 and 2.25 Hz. However,
  increased slow oscillatory activity was apparent in both hemispheres regardless
  of the side of the stimulation. The most robust increases in slow oscillatory activity
  appeared during the first 3-4 seconds of the stimulation period. Furthermore, a
  short-lasting increase in theta and sigma power was evidenced immediately after
  the first pulse of the stimulation sequences. Our findings indicate that lateralized
  RAS has a strong potential to globally enhance slow waves during daytime naps. The
  lack of localized effects suggests that slow waves are triggered by the ascending
  reticular system and not directly by specific auditory pathways.
