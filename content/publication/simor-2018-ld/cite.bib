 abstract = {Slow wave sleep (SWS) is characterized by the predominance of
delta waves and slow oscillations, reflecting the synchronized
activity of large cortical neuronal populations. Amongst other
functions, SWS plays a crucial role in the restorative capacity
of sleep. Rhythmic acoustic stimulation (RAS) during SWS has been
shown a cost-effective method to enhance slow wave activity. Slow
wave activity can be expressed in a region-specific manner as a
function of previous waking activity. However, it is unclear
whether slow waves can be enhanced in a region-specific manner
using RAS. We investigated the effects of unilaterally presented
rhythmic acoustic sound patterns on sleep electroencephalographic
(EEG) oscillations. Thirty-five participants received during SWS
12-second long rhythmic bursts of pink noise (at a rate of 1 Hz)
that alternated with non-stimulated, silent periods, unilaterally
delivered into one of the ears of the participants. As expected,
RAS enhanced delta power, especially in its low-frequency
components between 0.75 and 2.25 Hz. However, increased slow
oscillatory activity was apparent in both hemispheres regardless
of the side of the stimulation. The most robust increases in slow
oscillatory activity appeared during the first 3-4 seconds of the
stimulation period. Furthermore, a short-lasting increase in
theta and sigma power was evidenced immediately after the first
pulse of the stimulation sequences. Our findings indicate that
lateralized RAS has a strong potential to globally enhance slow
waves during daytime naps. The lack of localized effects suggests
that slow waves are triggered by the ascending reticular system
and not directly by specific auditory pathways.},
