abstract: Negative feedback in academic settings is often unavoidable, although it
  may directly interfere with the ultimate goal of education, as setbacks can diminish
  motivation, and may even lead to dropping out of school. Previous research suggests
  that certain predispositions, inductions, and interventions might mitigate the harmful
  effects of negative feedback. Among others, growth mindset beliefs and mindfulness
  meditation were proposed as the most promising candidates that may help students
  to retain motivation. In a pre-registered, randomized experiment, we gave a disappointing
  evaluation to 383 university students in a bogus laboratory IQ test situation. Half
  of the participants previously received a growth mindset induction referring to
  intelligence as a malleable characteristic, while the other half received a fixed
  mindset induction referring to intelligence as a stable characteristic that cannot
  be changed. Then participants had a brief mindfulness meditation session or a control
  condition. Subsequently, they could choose to complete practice tasks before the
  final IQ assessment. The number of completed optional tasks was used as a behavioral
  proxy for task persistence. The results showed no difference in task persistence
  for the growth mindset or the mindfulness induction groups, compared to the other
  conditions. However, those who reported having higher pre-induction growth mindset
  beliefs or dispositional mindfulness completed more optional tasks after the mindset
  or mindfulness induction, respectively. We concluded that our brief inductions may
  not be adequate for everyone to rectify the demotivating effects of negative feedback,
  but can enhance task persistence for people with a stronger disposition towards
  a growth mindset or mindfulness.
