 abstract = {Negative feedback in academic settings is often unavoidable,
although it may directly interfere with the ultimate goal of
education, as setbacks can diminish motivation, and may even
lead to dropping out of school. Previous research suggests that
certain predispositions, inductions, and interventions might
mitigate the harmful effects of negative feedback. Among others,
growth mindset beliefs and mindfulness meditation were proposed
as the most promising candidates that may help students to
retain motivation. In a pre-registered, randomized experiment,
we gave a disappointing evaluation to 383 university students in
a bogus laboratory IQ test situation. Half of the participants
previously received a growth mindset induction referring to
intelligence as a malleable characteristic, while the other half
received a fixed mindset induction referring to intelligence as
a stable characteristic that cannot be changed. Then
participants had a brief mindfulness meditation session or a
control condition. Subsequently, they could choose to complete
practice tasks before the final IQ assessment. The number of
completed optional tasks was used as a behavioral proxy for task
persistence. The results showed no difference in task
persistence for the growth mindset or the mindfulness induction
groups, compared to the other conditions. However, those who
reported having higher pre-induction growth mindset beliefs or
dispositional mindfulness completed more optional tasks after
the mindset or mindfulness induction, respectively. We concluded
that our brief inductions may not be adequate for everyone to
rectify the demotivating effects of negative feedback, but can
enhance task persistence for people with a stronger disposition
towards a growth mindset or mindfulness.},
