abstract: "The present study assessed selected factors that contribute to the recollection\
  \ of emotional memories over time. Participants with high-trait borderline personality\
  \ disorder (BPD) watched a randomly selected positive, negative, or neutral character\
  \ in a video clip (stimulus) and were asked to recall the content immediately, then\
  \ 2, 4, and 6 days later. In the final sample (N = 558, average age: 33 years, 65%\
  \ female), general impression had the strongest effect on recall after accounting\
  \ for the effect of current mood, extremity of the responses, and level of BPD,\
  \ regardless of stimulus valence. The level of BPD had an effect only when negative\
  \ evaluative wording (e.g., ``guilty'') was used. In conclusion, people with high-trait\
  \ BPD tend to remember negative stimuli more negatively over time (unlike neutral\
  \ or positive stimuli), and this effect is mostly related to general impression."
