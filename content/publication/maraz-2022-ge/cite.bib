 abstract = {The present study assessed selected factors that contribute to
the recollection of emotional memories over time. Participants
with high-trait borderline personality disorder (BPD) watched a
randomly selected positive, negative, or neutral character in a
video clip (stimulus) and were asked to recall the content
immediately, then 2, 4, and 6 days later. In the final sample (N
= 558, average age: 33 years, 65% female), general impression
had the strongest effect on recall after accounting for the
effect of current mood, extremity of the responses, and level of
BPD, regardless of stimulus valence. The level of BPD had an
effect only when negative evaluative wording (e.g., ``guilty'')
was used. In conclusion, people with high-trait BPD tend to
remember negative stimuli more negatively over time (unlike
neutral or positive stimuli), and this effect is mostly related
to general impression.},
