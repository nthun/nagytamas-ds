abstract: The role of subjective sleep quality in cognitive performance has gained
  increasing attention in recent decades. In this paper, our aim was to test the relationship
  between subjective sleep quality and a wide range of cognitive functions in a healthy
  young adult sample combined across three studies. Sleep quality was assessed by
  the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Athens Insomnia Scale, and a sleep diary
  to capture general subjective sleep quality, and the Groningen Sleep Quality Scale
  to capture prior night's sleep quality. Within cognitive functions, we tested working
  memory, executive functions, and several sub-processes of procedural learning. To
  provide more reliable results, we included robust frequentist as well as Bayesian
  statistical analyses. Unequivocally across all analyses, we showed that there is
  no association between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance in the
  domains of working memory, executive functions and procedural learning in healthy
  young adults. Our paper can contribute to a deeper understanding of subjective sleep
  quality and its measures, and we discuss various factors that may affect whether
  associations can be observed between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance.
