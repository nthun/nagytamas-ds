 abstract = {The role of subjective sleep quality in cognitive performance has
gained increasing attention in recent decades. In this paper, our
aim was to test the relationship between subjective sleep quality
and a wide range of cognitive functions in a healthy young adult
sample combined across three studies. Sleep quality was assessed
by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Athens Insomnia Scale,
and a sleep diary to capture general subjective sleep quality,
and the Groningen Sleep Quality Scale to capture prior night's
sleep quality. Within cognitive functions, we tested working
memory, executive functions, and several sub-processes of
procedural learning. To provide more reliable results, we
included robust frequentist as well as Bayesian statistical
analyses. Unequivocally across all analyses, we showed that there
is no association between subjective sleep quality and cognitive
performance in the domains of working memory, executive functions
and procedural learning in healthy young adults. Our paper can
contribute to a deeper understanding of subjective sleep quality
and its measures, and we discuss various factors that may affect
whether associations can be observed between subjective sleep
quality and cognitive performance.},
