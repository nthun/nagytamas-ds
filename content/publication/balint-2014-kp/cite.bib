 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine how certain characteristics of
film-presented practitioner role-models influence trainees'
mentalization. METHODS: In an experimental setting, psychology
students watched four film clips presenting a
patient-practitioner session; the clips varied in the
practitioner's patient-centeredness (positive vs. negative) and
gender. Participants commented on the practitioner's thoughts,
emotions and intentions through the session. Analysis of 116
comments focused on the effect of patient-centeredness and gender
variables on mentalization and judgment utterances. RESULTS:
Negative role-models and female role-models induced higher levels
of mentalization compared to positive and male role-models. There
was no gender difference in the level of mentalization; however
male participants gave more judgmental responses than female
participants. The patient-centeredness had a larger effect on
mentalization when trainees described the opposite gender
role-model. CONCLUSION: In a systematic comparison, students'
capacity for mentalization differed according to role-models'
patient-centeredness and gender, as well as the gender-match of
students with role-models. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: When working
with film-presented role-models, educators should be aware of the
differences in the level of mentalization elicited by positive
and male role-models, as opposed to negative and female
role-models. Educators should also consider the gender-match
between trainees and role-models, therefore students should be
exposed to both cross- and same-gender role-models.},
