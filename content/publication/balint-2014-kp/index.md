abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To examine how certain characteristics of film-presented practitioner\
  \ role-models influence trainees' mentalization. METHODS: In an experimental setting,\
  \ psychology students watched four film clips presenting a patient-practitioner\
  \ session; the clips varied in the practitioner's patient-centeredness (positive\
  \ vs. negative) and gender. Participants commented on the practitioner's thoughts,\
  \ emotions and intentions through the session. Analysis of 116 comments focused\
  \ on the effect of patient-centeredness and gender variables on mentalization and\
  \ judgment utterances. RESULTS: Negative role-models and female role-models induced\
  \ higher levels of mentalization compared to positive and male role-models. There\
  \ was no gender difference in the level of mentalization; however male participants\
  \ gave more judgmental responses than female participants. The patient-centeredness\
  \ had a larger effect on mentalization when trainees described the opposite gender\
  \ role-model. CONCLUSION: In a systematic comparison, students' capacity for mentalization\
  \ differed according to role-models' patient-centeredness and gender, as well as\
  \ the gender-match of students with role-models. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: When working\
  \ with film-presented role-models, educators should be aware of the differences\
  \ in the level of mentalization elicited by positive and male role-models, as opposed\
  \ to negative and female role-models. Educators should also consider the gender-match\
  \ between trainees and role-models, therefore students should be exposed to both\
  \ cross- and same-gender role-models."
