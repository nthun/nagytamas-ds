abstract: Following theories of emotional embodiment, the facial feedback hypothesis
  suggests that individuals' subjective experiences of emotion are influenced by their
  facial expressions. However, evidence for this hypothesis has been mixed. We thus
  formed a global adversarial collaboration and carried out a preregistered, multicentre
  study designed to specify and test the conditions that should most reliably produce
  facial feedback effects. Data from n = 3,878 participants spanning 19 countries
  indicated that a facial mimicry and voluntary facial action task could both amplify
  and initiate feelings of happiness. However, evidence of facial feedback effects
  was less conclusive when facial feedback was manipulated unobtrusively via a pen-in-mouth
  task.
