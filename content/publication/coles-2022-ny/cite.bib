 abstract = {Following theories of emotional embodiment, the facial feedback
hypothesis suggests that individuals' subjective experiences of
emotion are influenced by their facial expressions. However,
evidence for this hypothesis has been mixed. We thus formed a
global adversarial collaboration and carried out a
preregistered, multicentre study designed to specify and test
the conditions that should most reliably produce facial feedback
effects. Data from n = 3,878 participants spanning 19 countries
indicated that a facial mimicry and voluntary facial action task
could both amplify and initiate feelings of happiness. However,
evidence of facial feedback effects was less conclusive when
facial feedback was manipulated unobtrusively via a pen-in-mouth
task.},
