abstract: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, populations from
  many countries have been confined at home for extended periods of time in stressful
  environmental and media conditions. Cross-sectional studies already evidence deleterious
  psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental
  health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies
  and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences
  in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three
  European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online
  interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences
  for two consecutive weeks. The focus was set on between- and within-person associations
  of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences, such as rumination, psychotic-like
  experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus.
  The results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted
  increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints during
  the same day and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted
  sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study
  period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like
  experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association
  was not paralleled by daytime mental complaints predicting relatively poorer sleep
  quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in
  sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced
  by home confinement.
