 abstract = {Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
populations from many countries have been confined at home for
extended periods of time in stressful environmental and media
conditions. Cross-sectional studies already evidence deleterious
psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for
impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional
assessments are response bias tendencies and the inability to
track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in
extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted
across three European countries, we queried participants (N =
166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep
quality and their negative psychological experiences for two
consecutive weeks. The focus was set on between- and
within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with
daytime experiences, such as rumination, psychotic-like
experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of
the coronavirus. The results show that daily reports of
country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative
mood, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints during
the same day and decreased subjective sleep quality the following
night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative
psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively
poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination,
psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following
day. This temporal association was not paralleled by daytime
mental complaints predicting relatively poorer sleep quality on
the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night
changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next
day with daily challenges induced by home confinement.},
